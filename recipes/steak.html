        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Steak cooked like a chef - pan seared and basted with garlic thyme butter!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 boneless ribeye or scotch fillet, 2.5 cm / 1" thick, approx 300g/10 oz each</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>75g / 5 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into 1.25 cm / 1/2" cubes</li>
            <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme or 3 sprigs rosemary</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed to split</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring steaks to room temp 30 minutes prior</li>
            <li>Dry steaks: Pat dry with paper towels</li>
            <li>Heat skillet: Heat oil in a heavy based skillet over high heat until it is very hot - you should see smoke!</li>
            <li>Season: Sprinkle each side generously with salt and pepper, then immediately place in skillet</li>
            <li>Sear side 1: Cook for 2 - 2.5 minutes until you get a great crust, then turn</li>
            <li>Garlic butter: Leave for 1 minute then push steaks to one side and toss in butter, garlic, and thyme. Be careful - the thyme will sputter!</li>
            <li>Baste: As soon as the butter is melted, continuously spoon the butter over the steak until it's cooked to your liking - 2 minutes in total for the 2nd side for medium rare (52C/125F)</li>
            <li>Basting aso renders fat on the side of the steak - use tongs to sear the edges at the end if you want it browned more</li>
            <li>Rest: Transfer steak to a plate and cover loosely with foil, rest for 5 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Serve steak with a bit of the butter from the skillet drizzled on top</li>
        </ol>
